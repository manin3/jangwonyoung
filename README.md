Team Captain - Pascal

## What topic have you chosen? Why is it a problem? How does it relate to the theme and to the class?
We have chosen Youtube Somment Sentiment Analysis, which is relevant because Youtube removed their dislikes, so it is often hard to discern whether people actually like a given video or not. We need to extract large bodies of text from the comment section of a video, and perform analysis on it to determine what sentiment it shows. 

## Briefly describe any datasets, algorithms or techniques you plan to use
We will just scrape the comments section of several hand picked videos, and utilize natural language processing algorithms/concepts such as stemming, tokenization, and POS tagging in combination with sentiment analysis libraries. 

## How will you demonstrate that your approach will work as expected? 
There are currently other programs that are able to estimate the amount of dislikes on a youtube video, so we can compare the sentiment that our project finds and see if it correlates to the estimated like/dislike ratio.

## Which programming language do you plan to use?
Python/JavaScript

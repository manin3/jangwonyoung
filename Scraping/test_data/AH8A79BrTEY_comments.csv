Heartsteel♡
Rise wanted to run that back since the 2018 incident.
"Teknologi yang benar-benar inovatif, terutama panggung HEARTSTELL, wow mereka yang luar biasa. 
Salam hangat dari penggemar Baekhyun."
I love everything about heartsteel
A bit disappointed with production quality behind audio but the singers did great.
dafaq this was amazing asf very surprised
newjeans never disappoint ❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥❤️‍🔥
new jeans only playback zzzz
"ctrl,alt,del of destruction"
For some reason new jeans don't look like they're lip syncing as much as they were in the live version 😅
"it is incredibly good, finally newjeans God live performance!!!!"
BLACKPINK nunca 😢😢
Heartstill must comeback
The Heartsteel guys did it very well without needing so much production! I hope to hear more songs from them in the future and see live and virtual performances. Congratulations 💞
BAEKZREAL IS REAL 🔥 PROUD OF U 💛
"Don’t hate me I prefer heartsteel performance, than New jeans. But yeah great show!"
"IN BAEKHYUN LIVE VOCALS SUPREMACY, WE BELIEVE!!!!"
GAGAGA
"WE LOVE YOU, NEWJEANS!"
Byun baekhyunn!!!😭😭❤️
"HEARTSTELL ate all the performance. I'm so proud of my love, Baekhyun. His vocal and dance are powerful and he is so excited. Baekzreal you did very well ❤️😘🐶🤘"
"why not available in 4k, such a unique event and this was recorded in 1080p, are we living in 2010 "
This is by far the best ever opening ceremony.
We want more of HEARTSTEEL!!! They did amazing. Baekhyun has my heart <3 he is such a performer.
HEARTS? STOLEN.
THEY ALL SLAYED SO HARD OMG!!
"HEARTSTEEL Slayed!!! All the membersTobi,Ozi,Cal & Baek killed it, Baekhyun really gave all his energy on stage. Love it, so proud as an Exo-L ❤, I was expecting a bit longer performance & better camera work but nevertheless I really enjoyed."
"As an ExoL, I cannot put it in words how proud I am of Baekhyun!! Those vocals with that Top notch Dance!!?? We definitely need a full Paranoia performance of Heartsteel!!"
